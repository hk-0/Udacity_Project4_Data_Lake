# Project Sparkify - Data Lake

## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, I am tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Project Description

In this project, I will apply what I've learned on Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. To complete the project, I will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. I will deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

## Database Model and Schema

The data model is implemented using a star schema. The schema contains one fact table, `songplays`, and four dimension tables: `songs`, `artists`, `users` and `time`.

#### Fact Tables

**`songplays`**
| COLUMN      | TYPE      | CONSTRAINT  |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| songplay_id | SERIAL    | PRIMARY KEY |
| start_time  | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL    |
| user_id     | INT       | NOT NULL    |
| level       | VARCHAR   |             |
| song_id     | VARCHAR   |             |
| artist_id   | VARCHAR   |             |
| session_id  | INT       |             |
| location    | VARCHAR   |             |
| user_agent  | VARCHAR   |             |

#### Dimension Tables

**`users`**
| COLUMN     | TYPE    | CONSTRAINT  |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| user_id    | INT     | PRIMARY KEY |
| first_name | VARCHAR | NOT NULL    |
| last_name  | VARCHAR | NOT NULL    |
| gender     | VARCHAR |             |
| level      | VARCHAR |             |

**`songs`**
| COLUMN    | TYPE    | CONSTRAINT  |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| song_id   | VARCHAR | PRIMARY KEY |
| title     | VARCHAR | NOT NULL    |
| artist_id | VARCHAR | NOT NULL    |
| year      | INT     | NOT NULL    |
| duration  | NUMERIC | NOT NULL    |

**`artist`**
| COLUMN    | TYPE             | CONSTRAINT  |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| artist_id | VARCHAR          | PRIMARY KEY |
| name      | VARCHAR          | NOT NULL    |
| location  | VARCHAR          |             |
| latitude  | DOUBLE PRECISION |             |
| longitude | DOUBLE PRECISION |             |

**`time`**
| COLUMN     | TYPE      | CONSTRAINT  |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| start_time | TIMESTAMP | PRIMARY KEY |
| hour       | INT       |             |
| day        | INT       |             |
| week       | INT       |             |
| month      | INT       |             |
| year       | INT       |             |
| weekday    | INT       |             |

## Project Dataset

S3 data path

- Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
- Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`


### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json`

`song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`

And below is an example of what a single song file, `TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`, looks like.

> {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.
The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json`

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, `2018-11-12-events.json`, looks like.

## Execution

`dl.cfg`

Add the S3 credentials in dl.cfg file which will be required to read and write the data in the S3 buckets.

`etl.py`

The script uses Apache spark to read the song and log data in the S3 bucket, transforms the data into fact and dimensional tables and then loads the table data into output_data S3 bucket in parquet format.
